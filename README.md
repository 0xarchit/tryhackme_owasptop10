# OWASP Top 10 Report

## A. Objective

The objective of this report is to provide a comprehensive overview of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities as explored in the TryHackMe room. This report will detail each vulnerability's significance, practical implications, and exploitation methods, equipping readers with the knowledge to enhance web application security.

## B. What is OWASP Top 10

The **OWASP Top 10** is a widely recognized report published by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). It outlines the ten most critical security risks to web applications, serving as a foundational resource for developers and security professionals. The list is updated periodically based on data collected from various organizations and reflects current trends in web application security threats. The OWASP Top 10 aims to raise awareness about these vulnerabilities, promote secure coding practices, and guide organizations in prioritizing their security efforts.

## C. Need for OWASP Top 10

The need for the OWASP Top 10 arises from the increasing complexity of web applications and the evolving landscape of cyber threats. Key reasons for its importance include:

- **Prioritization of Security Efforts**: Organizations can focus on addressing the most critical vulnerabilities that could lead to significant breaches.
- **Education and Awareness**: It provides essential training resources for developers about secure coding practices and common pitfalls.
- **Improved Security Posture**: By implementing measures to mitigate these vulnerabilities, organizations can enhance their overall application security.
